Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
- What are your initial impressions of Java?
It was a lot to get use to. However, once getting used to the syntax, it became easier to work with and understand. Once you understand the syntax, I think it isn't as difficult to work with. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I think java is a bit more restricted than python. I feel like I had to find a lot of work arounds for specific parts of my code that I feel is more straightfoward in python.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
GO TO TA AND OFFICE HOURS !!! I cannot stress this enough. I should probably listen to my own advice and go. It can be a bit scary to go to office hours/TA hours, but life will be so much easier. Also, don't be afraid to reach out for help in general! And more importantly, start the assignments early or you'll fall behind..
